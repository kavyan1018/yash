Now, let me explain the diagrams and the assumptions made:
Context Diagram (Level 0):
This diagram shows the HMS as a single process interacting with external entities.
External Entities:

Patient: Provides information and requests appointments
Doctor: Inputs treatment details and receives patient history
Admin: Manages staff information and receives reports
Pharmacy: Manages medicine stock and receives prescriptions

Assumptions:

The system interacts directly with patients for appointments and medical records
Doctors use the system to access and update patient information
Admins use the system for staff management and reporting
The pharmacy is integrated into the system for medication management

Level 1 DFD:
This diagram breaks down the HMS into its major subsystems and shows how data flows between them.
Processes:

Patient Management: Handles patient registration and information
Appointment Scheduling: Manages appointment bookings
Medical Records Management: Stores and retrieves patient medical histories
Billing: Processes payments for medical services
Pharmacy Management: Handles medication inventory and prescriptions

Data Flows:

Patient information flows from Patient to Patient Management
Appointment requests flow from Patient to Appointment Scheduling
Medical records flow between Medical Records Management and Doctor
Treatment details flow from Medical Records Management to Billing
Inventory data flows between Admin and Pharmacy Management
Prescription information flows between Pharmacy Management and Pharmacy

Assumptions:

Patient Management and Appointment Scheduling are separate processes
Medical Records Management is central to the system, interacting with multiple processes
Billing is integrated into the system, receiving data from Medical Records Management
Pharmacy Management is included as a major process within the HMS

These diagrams provide a high-level overview of the data flows within a Hospital Management System. They show how information moves between different parts of the system and external entities.
