Software Project Management Overview:
A systematic approach to planning, organizing, and managing resources to achieve successful software development outcomes.
Key Tasks in Software Project Management:

--> --> --> -->  Project Planning
A. Scope Definition
   - Project objectives
   - Deliverables
   - Constraints
   - Assumptions

B. Schedule Planning
   □ Create WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)
   □ Task identification
   □ Timeline creation
   □ Resource allocation

C. Cost Estimation
   - Development costs
   - Hardware/software costs
   - Training costs
   - Maintenance costs

--> --> --> --> Resource Management:
A. Human Resources
   - Team composition
   - Skill requirements
   - Role assignment
   - Training needs

B. Technical Resources
   - Hardware requirements
   - Software tools
   - Development environment
   - Testing tools

--> --> --> --> Risk Management:
Risk Assessment Matrix:
┌──────────────┬───────────┬──────────┬───────────┐
│ Risk Type    │ Impact    │ Prob.    │ Mitigation│
├──────────────┼───────────┼──────────┼───────────┤
│ Technical    │ High      │ Medium   │ Plan A    │
│ Schedule     │ Medium    │ High     │ Plan B    │
│ Resource     │ High      │ Low      │ Plan C    │
└──────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴───────────┘

--> --> --> --> Quality Management:
A. Quality Planning
   □ Define quality standards
   □ Establish metrics
   □ Set acceptance criteria

B. Quality Control
   □ Code reviews
   □ Testing procedures
   □ Documentation review
   □ Performance monitoring

--> --> --> Time Management:
Project Timeline Example:
Month 1-2: Requirements & Planning
├── Week 1-2: Requirement gathering
├── Week 3-4: System analysis
├── Week 5-6: Design planning
└── Week 7-8: Resource allocation

Month 3-6: Development
├── Sprint 1: Core features
├── Sprint 2: Additional features
├── Sprint 3: Integration
└── Sprint 4: Testing & Bug fixes

Month 7-8: Testing & Deployment

--> --> --> Cost Management:
Budget Breakdown Example:
1. Development Costs (50%)
   - Staff salaries
   - Equipment
   - Software licenses

2. Operation Costs (30%)
   - Infrastructure
   - Maintenance
   - Support

3. Contingency (20%)
   - Risk mitigation
   - Change requests
   - Unforeseen expenses

--> --> --> Communication Management:
CopyCommunication Plan:
1. Daily Standups
   - Team updates
   - Blocker discussion
   - Priority alignment

2. Weekly Status Reports
   - Progress tracking
   - Issue resolution
   - Risk updates

3. Monthly Reviews
   - Milestone tracking
   - Budget review
   - Stakeholder updates

--> --> --> --> Change Management:
Change Control Process:
1. Change Request
   └── Impact Analysis
       └── Approval Process
           └── Implementation
               └── Verification

Change Categories:
- Scope changes
- Technical changes
- Resource changes
- Schedule changes

--> --> --> Documentation Management:
Document Types:
1. Project Documents
   - Project charter
   - Project plan
   - Status reports

2. Technical Documents
   - Requirements spec
   - Design documents
   - Test plans

3. User Documents
   - User manuals
   - Training materials
   - Support docs

--> --> --> Monitoring and Control:
--> Monitoring Metrics:
1. Progress Metrics
   □ Task completion rate
   □ Sprint velocity
   □ Burndown chart

2. Quality Metrics
   □ Defect density
   □ Code coverage
   □ Customer satisfaction

3. Performance Metrics
   □ Resource utilization
   □ Cost variance
   □ Schedule variance
