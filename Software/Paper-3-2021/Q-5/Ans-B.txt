Below is an ER diagram (ERD) for a Hospital Management System (HMS) that illustrates how various entities are related. Key assumptions made include:

1. Patients are registered in the system and can have multiple Appointments with different Doctors.
2. Doctors are associated with specific Departments (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology).
3. Each Appointment** can involve various Treatments and Lab Tests.
4. Bills are generated based on the Treatments and Lab Tests for each patient visit.
