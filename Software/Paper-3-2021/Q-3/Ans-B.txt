The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a framework that describes the key elements of an effective software development process. It provides a path for organizations to improve their software development practices through five maturity levels:

--> Level 1 - Initial (Chaotic)
Processes are unpredictable and poorly controlled
Success depends on individual effort
No formal procedures or documentation


--> Level 2 - Repeatable (Managed)
Basic project management processes established
Previous successes can be repeated
Project planning and tracking implemented
Basic documentation exists


--> Level 3 - Defined
Standard processes documented across organization
Processes are more consistent
Training programs established
Proactive rather than reactive management


--> Level 4 - Quantitatively Managed
Detailed metrics collected and analyzed
Process performance is quantitatively predictable
Quality goals are measured
Precise understanding of process capability


--> Level 5 - Optimizing
Continuous process improvement
Innovation and optimization
Defect prevention
Technology and process change management



--> --> Key Benefits:
Improved product quality
Increased productivity
Better predictability
Reduced development costs
Enhanced customer satisfaction

--> --> The model helps organizations:
Assess their current process maturity
Identify critical areas for improvement
Set priorities for improvement actions
Guide process improvement programs
