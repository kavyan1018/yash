## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Hospital Management System (HMS). It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of the system. It will also explain system constraints, interface, and interactions with other external applications.

### 1.2 Scope

The Hospital Management System is designed to streamline hospital operations, improve patient care, and enhance overall efficiency. The system will manage various aspects of hospital administration including patient records, appointments, billing, inventory, and staff management.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- HMS: Hospital Management System
- EHR: Electronic Health Record
- GUI: Graphical User Interface
- DBMS: Database Management System

### 1.5 Overview

The remainder of this document provides a general description of the HMS, including product functions, user characteristics, constraints, and requirements. Section 2 offers an overview of the functionality and factors that affect the product and its requirements. Section 3 provides the specific requirements for this system.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

The HMS is a new, self-contained system designed to be used by hospitals of various sizes. It will interface with existing hospital equipment and may integrate with third-party systems such as laboratory information systems or pharmacy management systems.

### 2.2 Product Functions

The main functions of the HMS include:

- Patient registration and management
- Appointment scheduling
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) management
- Billing and insurance processing
- Inventory management
- Staff management and scheduling
- Reporting and analytics

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

The HMS will be used by several user classes, including:

- Administrators
- Doctors
- Nurses
- Laboratory Technicians
- Pharmacists
- Front Desk Staff
- Billing Staff
- Patients (for a limited patient portal)

### 2.4 Operating Environment

The HMS will operate in a networked environment, accessible via web browsers on desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The server will run on a Linux-based operating system, and the database will be managed by a robust DBMS such as PostgreSQL.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- The system must comply with HIPAA regulations for patient data privacy and security.
- The system should be scalable to accommodate growing hospital needs.
- The system must be able to handle concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
- The user interface must be intuitive and accessible to users with varying levels of technical proficiency.

### 2.6 User Documentation

User documentation will include:

- Online help system
- User manuals for each user class
- Installation and system administration guide
- Video tutorials for common tasks

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

- The hospital will provide necessary hardware infrastructure.
- Users will have basic computer literacy.
- The system will have reliable internet connectivity.
- Third-party systems (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy) will have APIs for integration.

## 3. Specific Requirements
