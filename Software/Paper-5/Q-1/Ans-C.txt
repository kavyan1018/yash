Let me explain the function-oriented design approach for the ATM system:

1. System Decomposition:
The ATM system is broken down into major functions:

A. Authentication (1.0)
   - Validate Card (1.1)
     - Read card data
     - Check card validity
   - Check PIN (1.2)
     - Accept PIN input
     - Verify PIN against database
   - Block Card (1.3)
     - Track invalid attempts
     - Block card after limit exceeded

B. Transaction Processing (2.0)
   - Check Balance (2.1)
     - Retrieve account balance
     - Display balance
   - Withdraw Money (2.2)
     - Verify balance
     - Process withdrawal
     - Update account
   - Deposit Money (2.3)
     - Accept deposit
     - Verify amount
     - Update account
   - Transfer Funds (2.4)
     - Verify accounts
     - Process transfer
     - Update both accounts

C. Receipt Generation (3.0)
   - Generate Receipt (3.1)
     - Format transaction details
     - Add timestamp
   - Print Receipt (3.2)
     - Print physical receipt
     - Handle printer errors
   - Send SMS Alert (3.3)
     - Format SMS message
     - Send to banking system

2. Data Dictionary:

```
Data Elements:
- Card_Number: 16-digit numeric
- PIN: 4-digit numeric
- Account_Balance: Decimal number
- Transaction_Amount: Decimal number
- Transaction_Type: Enum {WITHDRAWAL, DEPOSIT, TRANSFER, BALANCE}
- Receipt_Data: Structure containing transaction details
```

3. Data Flow Analysis:

A. Input Data Flows:
   - Card information
   - PIN entry
   - Transaction selection
   - Amount entry
   - Recipient account (for transfers)

B. Output Data Flows:
   - Balance display
   - Transaction confirmation
   - Error messages
   - Receipt printing
   - SMS notifications

4. Function Specifications:

Example for Withdraw Money (2.2):
```
Function: Withdraw_Money
Input: 
    - Account_Number
    - Amount
Output:
    - Transaction_Status
    - Updated_Balance
Process:
    1. Verify account balance
    2. Check withdrawal limits
    3. Process transaction
    4. Update account balance
    5. Trigger receipt generation
Error Handling:
    - Insufficient funds
    - Invalid amount
    - Hardware errors
```

5. Module Coupling and Cohesion:

A. Coupling Examples:
   - Authentication module must complete before Transaction Processing
   - Receipt Generation depends on Transaction Processing output
   - SMS alerts depend on transaction completion

B. Cohesion Analysis:
   - Authentication functions grouped together
   - Transaction functions separated by type
   - Output handling consolidated in Receipt module

6. Design Benefits:

A. Maintainability:
   - Each function is independent
   - Easy to modify individual modules
   - Clear separation of concerns

B. Testability:
   - Functions can be tested independently
   - Clear inputs and outputs
   - Easy to mock dependencies

C. Scalability:
   - New transaction types can be added
   - Additional authentication methods can be implemented
   - Output formats can be extended

7. Implementation Considerations:

A. Error Handling:
   - Each function includes error checking
   - Standardized error responses
   - Transaction rollback capability

B. Security:
   - Authentication before any transaction
   - Encrypted communication
   - Session management

C. Performance:
   - Optimized database queries
   - Efficient state management
   - Fast response times

This function-oriented design approach helps in:
1. Clear organization of system functionality
2. Easy maintenance and updates
3. Better error handling and security
4. Simplified testing and debugging
5. Scalable system architecture

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this function-oriented design or provide more details about any particular function?
