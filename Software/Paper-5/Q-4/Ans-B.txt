McCall's Quality Factors, introduced by James A. McCall, are a set of criteria designed to assess software quality. They help evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a software product based on key attributes. McCall's model divides these factors into three main categories: Product Operation, Product Revision, and Product Transition. Each factor in these categories represents essential qualities for building effective, maintainable, and adaptable software systems.

 1. Product Operation Factors
   These factors focus on how well the software performs in an operational environment, particularly concerning functionality, reliability, and usability.

   - Correctness: Measures the extent to which the software fulfills its specifications and meets user needs.
   - Reliability: Evaluates the software’s ability to perform its functions accurately under specified conditions for a defined period.
   - Efficiency: Assesses the system’s optimal use of resources, such as CPU, memory, and disk space.
   - Integrity: Focuses on the system's ability to prevent unauthorized access or alterations to data.
   - Usability: Reflects how easy it is for users to learn, operate, and prepare inputs and outputs in the system.

 2. Product Revision Factors
   These factors assess the software’s adaptability and flexibility to change, important for long-term software maintenance.

   - Maintainability: Examines how easily modifications can be made to the software to correct defects or update features.
   - Flexibility: Measures the ease with which the software can be adapted to different environments or requirements.
   - Testability: Focuses on how easily and effectively the software can be tested to ensure it meets its requirements.

 3. Product Transition Factors
   These factors evaluate the software’s adaptability for future transitions to new platforms or changes in the environment.

   - Portability: Reflects the software’s ability to operate in different computing environments with minimal modification.
   - Reusability: Determines the extent to which software components can be reused in other applications or scenarios.
   - Interoperability: Measures the software’s capability to interact with other systems or software effectively.

McCall’s Quality Factors provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating software quality. By addressing these factors during development, teams can create software that is functional, reliable, maintainable, and adaptable to future needs.
