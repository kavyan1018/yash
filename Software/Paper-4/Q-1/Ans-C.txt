The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It is one of the earliest models in software engineering and is often referred to as a "one-way" or "non-iterative" approach.

Phases of the Waterfall Model:
--------------------------------------
    -->Requirement Analysis: The requirements of the system are gathered and analyzed. This phase focuses on what the system should do.
    -->System Design: Based on requirements, the architecture and design of the system are created.
    -->Implementation: The design is translated into code by developers, and the actual development of software takes place.
    -->Testing: The software is tested to find and fix any issues or bugs.
    -->Deployment: The software is deployed to the customer for their use.
    -->Maintenance: Post-deployment, any issues that arise are addressed, and updates or changes are made as necessary.


Nature of Problems Suitable for the Waterfall Model :
---------------------------------------------------------
The Waterfall model is best suited for projects where:
    -->Requirements are Stable and Well-understood: Projects where requirements are clear, fixed, and not expected to change.
    -->Short Duration and Well-defined Projects: Projects with a relatively short timeline and where each phase is well-defined.
    -->Compliance-driven Projects: Projects requiring stringent documentation, such as those in regulated industries (e.g., healthcare or defense).
    -->Low Complexity: Smaller or simpler projects where a linear approach can adequately capture all necessary features without iterations.

Demerits of the Waterfall Model :
-----------------------------------------
The Waterfall model has several drawbacks, especially in complex and evolving software projects:
    -->Lack of Flexibility: It is challenging to make changes once a phase is completed. Any significant change requires revisiting earlier stages, which is time-consuming and costly.
    -->Late Testing Phase: Since testing is done after implementation, any issues found at this stage can be difficult and costly to resolve.
    -->Limited Customer Feedback: Customer involvement is mostly at the beginning and end, limiting feedback and potentially leading to a product that doesn’t fully meet user expectations.
    -->High Risk in Long-term Projects: For longer projects, there’s a risk that the requirements might change over time, making the final product less relevant or outdated by the time it's delivered.
    -->Assumes Clear Requirements: The model assumes that requirements are clear and stable from the beginning, which is often not the case in real-world projects.
