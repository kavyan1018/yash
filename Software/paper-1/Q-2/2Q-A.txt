Q --> Draw the zero and first level DFD for OSCAS. Make necessary assumptions.

Ans ->  



Let me explain the key components of these diagrams:

Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram): in img name level-0-dfd.png

Shows the system's interaction with external entities (Student, Instructor, Administrator)
Displays the main data flows in and out of the system
Provides a high-level overview of the system's scope

Level 1 DFD: level-1-dfd.png

1) Breaks down the system into five main processes:

1 User Authentication
2 Course Management
3 Assessment Management
4 Submission Handling
5 Grading System


2) Shows four data stores:

User Data
Course Data
Assessment Data
Submission Data


Illustrates how data flows between processes and data stores
Maintains the external entities from Level 0

Key features of the system shown in the DFDs:

All users must authenticate through Process 1.0
Course management (Process 2.0) is handled by both instructors and administrators
Assessment creation and management (Process 3.0) is primarily done by instructors
Students interact mainly with Processes 3.0 and 4.0 for viewing and submitting assessments
The grading system (Process 5.0) connects instructors' grading with students viewing their results

These diagrams provide a comprehensive view of how the Online Student Course Assessment System functions and how different users interact with various system components.
