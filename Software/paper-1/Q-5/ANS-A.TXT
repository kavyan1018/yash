The SEI-CMM defines five maturity levels for software processes, each representing a different stage of process maturity. These levels provide a framework for organizations to improve their software development processes. Here are the five levels:

Initial (Level 1): ->
Characteristics:
Processes are ad hoc and chaotic
Success depends on individual efforts and heroics
Unpredictable and reactive approach


Key points:
No stable environment for software development
Projects often exceed budgets and schedules
Processes are not defined or are poorly defined




Repeatable (Level 2): ->
Characteristics:
Basic project management processes are established
Earlier successes can be repeated on similar projects


Key processes areas:
Requirements management
Software project planning
Software project tracking and oversight
Software subcontract management
Software quality assurance
Software configuration management




Defined (Level 3): ->
Characteristics:
Standard processes for developing and maintaining software are documented
Processes are integrated into a coherent whole


Key process areas:
Organization process focus
Organization process definition
Training program
Integrated software management
Software product engineering
Intergroup coordination
Peer reviews




Managed (Level 4): ->
Characteristics:
Detailed measures of the software process and product quality are collected
Processes and products are quantitatively understood and controlled


Key process areas:
Quantitative process management
Software quality management
Defect prevention
Technology change management




Optimizing (Level 5): ->
Characteristics:
Continuous process improvement is enabled by quantitative feedback and piloting innovative ideas
Focus on process improvement


Key process areas:
Process change management
Technology change management
Defect prevention


Each level builds upon the previous one, creating a cumulative effect. Organizations typically progress through these levels sequentially, though it's possible to skip levels (though not recommended).

The SEI-CMM provides several benefits: -> 
It offers a roadmap for process improvement
It helps in assessing the current state of an organization's processes
It provides a common language and shared vision for process improvement
It can be used as a benchmark for comparing different organizations

It's worth noting that while the original CMM has been superseded by newer models like CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration), the core concept of these five maturity levels remains influential in software engineering and project management.
