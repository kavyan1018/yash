Draw PERT chart for the development of OAS



--> Here are the main tasks we'll include in our PERT chart:
1)Project Initiation and Planning
2)->Requirements Gathering and Analysis
3)->System Design
4)->Database Design
5)->User Interface Design
6)->Backend Development
7)->Frontend Development
8)->Integration and Testing
9)->Security Implementation
10)->User Acceptance Testing
11)->Deployment
12)->Project Closure


1->Project Initiation & Planning (5 days): The starting point of the project.
2->Requirements Gathering & Analysis (10 days): Follows Project Initiation.
3->System Design (7 days): Begins after Requirements Gathering.
4->Database Design (7 days): Starts after System Design.
5->User Interface Design (7 days): Can be done concurrently with Database Design.
6->Backend Development (20 days): Follows Database Design.
7->Frontend Development (15 days): Can start after UI Design and progress concurrently with Backend Development.
8->Integration and Testing (10 days): Begins when both Backend and Frontend Development are complete.
9->Security Implementation (5 days): Follows Integration and Testing.
10->User Acceptance Testing (7 days): Begins after Security Implementation.
11->Deployment (3 days): Follows User Acceptance Testing.
12->Project Closure (2 days): The final stage of the project.


Key points about this PERT chart:

--> The critical path is the longest sequence of dependent tasks, which determines the minimum project duration. In this case, it's likely the path through Backend Development.
--> Some tasks can be done in parallel, like Database Design and UI Design, or Backend and Frontend Development.
--> The chart shows dependencies between tasks, indicating which tasks must be completed before others can begin.
--> I've added estimated durations for each task in days. These are hypothetical and would need to be adjusted based on the specific project requirements and team capacity.
--> Project Initiation and Project Closure are styled differently as milestones.

This PERT chart provides a high-level view of the project timeline and dependencies. It can be used to identify the critical path, plan resources, and manage the project schedule.
