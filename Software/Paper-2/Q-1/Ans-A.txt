To develop a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for an Online Admission System (OAS) for a university in IEEE format, follow the IEEE 830-1998 standard, which defines the structure of an SRS document. Below is an outline for creating the SRS:
---

### **1. Introduction**

#### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the Online Admission System (OAS) for a university, which allows prospective students to apply for admissions, and university administrators to manage applications online.

#### 1.2 Scope
The OAS will facilitate the application process for undergraduate and postgraduate programs. It will support application submission, status tracking, fee payment, document uploading, and result declaration.

#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- OAS: Online Admission System
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification
- Admin: University personnel managing the system

#### 1.4 References
- IEEE SRS Standard (830-1998)
- University Admission Guidelines (Assumed)
- Related online systems and platforms

#### 1.5 Overview
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the OAS. It is intended for developers, testers, and stakeholders.

### **2. Overall Description**

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
The OAS is a standalone web-based application that integrates with the universityâ€™s existing database and student management systems.

#### 2.2 Product Features
- Online form submission
- Document upload (PDF, images)
- Fee payment via secure gateway
- Application tracking
- Admin panel for review and management

#### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Applicants**: Prospective students with basic computer knowledge.
- **Admin**: University staff with technical proficiency to manage the system.
  
#### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Database (MySQL or similar)
- Payment gateway integration

#### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must follow university data security policies.
- Compatible with existing university infrastructure.

#### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Internet access is available to users.
- The university has a payment gateway for online transactions.

### **3. Specific Requirements**

#### 3.1 Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**: The system will allow users to create accounts with email verification.
2. **Form Submission**: Users can fill out application forms for the desired programs.
3. **Document Upload**: Users will be able to upload supporting documents (marksheets, certificates).
4. **Payment Integration**: Users can pay application fees online.
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Admins will review applications and update statuses.
6. **Email Notifications**: Automatic emails will be sent to applicants regarding status updates.
7. **Result Declaration**: Applicants can check the status of their admission through the portal.

#### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: The system must be secure, protecting sensitive user data with encryption.
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak admission periods.
- **Usability**: The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime during the admission process.
- **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to update and maintain.

#### 3.3 External Interface Requirements
- **User Interface**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend.
- **Hardware Interface**: Servers supporting database and web application.
- **Software Interface**: Integration with payment gateways, university databases.

### **4. Other Non-Functional Requirements**

#### 4.1 Performance Requirements
The system should load pages within 2 seconds under normal conditions and support high volumes of data.

#### 4.2 Safety Requirements
Regular data backups and disaster recovery mechanisms must be in place.

#### 4.3 Security Requirements
- Role-based access for users and admins.
- Two-factor authentication for admins.

#### 4.4 Software Quality Attributes
The system must be scalable to accommodate future enhancements, such as adding new programs or integration with mobile platforms.
