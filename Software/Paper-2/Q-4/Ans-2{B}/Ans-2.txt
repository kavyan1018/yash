What meant by static object ? How will you identify them ? Explain.


Static Objects:
A static object, also known as a class object, is an object that belongs to a class rather than to any specific instance of the class. In other words, it's shared by all instances of a class and exists independently of any instances of that class.
Key characteristics of static objects:

Shared among all instances: All instances of a class share the same static object.

Exist without class instantiation: Static objects are created when the class is loaded, not when an instance is created.

Accessed through the class name: They are typically accessed using the class name rather than through an instance.

Memory efficiency: Only one copy exists in memory, regardless of how many instances of the class are created.

In this diagram, we can identify several static objects:

In the AuctionSystem class:

static instance: This is part of the Singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of AuctionSystem exists.
static userCount: A shared counter for all users in the system.
static getInstance(): A factory method to get the single instance of AuctionSystem.
static getUserCount() and incrementUserCount(): Methods to interact with the shared user count.

In the User class:
static validateEmail(): A utility method to validate email formats, which doesn't depend on any specific User instance.

In the Auction class:
static MINIMUM_DURATION: A constant representing the minimum duration for all auctions.
static calculateDuration(): A utility method to calculate auction duration, which doesn't depend on a specific Auction instance.

These static objects are identified because they:   ---> 
Represent shared resources (userCount)
Implement utility functions (validateEmail, calculateDuration)
Define constants (MINIMUM_DURATION)
Implement design patterns like Singleton (instance, getInstance())
