What is meant by function oriented design ? Explain the concept associations with function oriented design.

Let me explain the key concepts associated with function-oriented design:

1) -> Decomposition:
Function-oriented design uses a top-down approach to break down a complex system into smaller, more manageable functions. This process is called functional decomposition.

2) -> Modularity:
The system is divided into separate modules, each responsible for a specific function or set of related functions. This promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.

3) -> Function Independence:
Functions are designed to be as independent as possible, minimizing coupling between modules. This makes the system more flexible and easier to modify.

4) ->Data Flow:
Function-oriented design often uses data flow diagrams (DFDs) to represent how data moves between different functions in the system.

5)--> Structured Programming:
This approach encourages the use of structured programming techniques, such as sequence, selection, and iteration, to implement the functions.

6)--> Abstraction:
Complex operations are abstracted into simpler functions, hiding the implementation details from the user of the function.

7)-> Reusability:
Functions are designed to be reusable across different parts of the system or even in different systems.

8)-->Maintainability:
By organizing code around functions, it becomes easier to locate and fix issues or add new features without affecting the entire system.

9)->Procedural Programming:
Function-oriented design is closely associated with procedural programming languages like C, where the focus is on procedures or routines.

10) --> Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model:
Functions are often designed following the IPO model, where they take inputs, process them, and produce outputs.
11) --> Function Libraries:
Common functions can be grouped into libraries, promoting code reuse and standardization.

12) --> Stepwise Refinement:
The design process often involves stepwise refinement, where high-level functions are progressively broken down into more detailed subfunctions.

13)--> Control Hierarchy:
Functions are often organized in a hierarchical structure, with higher-level functions calling lower-level functions.
