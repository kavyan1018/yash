Q -> Draw the Zero and first level DFDs for OAS. Make necessary assumptions.

This Context Diagram shows the main external entities interacting with the Online Auction System:

Bidder: Places bids, registers/logs in, and views items.
Seller: Lists items for auction and registers/logs in.
Administrator: Manages users and auctions.


This Level 1 DFD breaks down the Online Auction System into six main processes:

1->User Management: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
2->Item Management: Manages the listing and viewing of auction items.
3->Auction Management: Controls the auction process, including start and end times.
4->Bid Processing: Handles the placement and processing of bids.
5->Notification System: Sends notifications to users about auction events.
6->Reporting: Generates system reports for administrators.

The diagram also includes four data stores:

1->User Data: Stores information about registered users.
2->Item Data: Stores details about items listed for auction.
3->Auction Data: Stores information about ongoing and completed auctions.
4->Bid Data: Stores all bid information.

Assumptions made for this system:
There are three main user types: Bidders, Sellers, and Administrators.
Users must register and login to interact with the system.
Sellers can list items for auction.
Bidders can view items and place bids.
The system processes bids and manages auctions automatically.
The system sends notifications to users about relevant events.
Administrators can manage users and auctions, and view system reports.
