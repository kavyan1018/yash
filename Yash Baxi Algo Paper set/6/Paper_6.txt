Question - 1(A)
--------------------

Big Theta (Θ) notation is used to describe the asymptotic behavior of functions. It provides tight bounds on the growth rate of a function, both from above and below.

A function f(n) is said to be Θ(g(n)) if and only if there exist positive constants 𝑐1,𝑐2, and 𝑛0 such that:

c1⋅g(n)≤f(n)≤c2⋅g(n)

for all𝑛 ≥ 𝑛0.

Now, let's use this definition to show that 7𝑛2+8n−9=Θ(n2).

We need to find constants 𝑐1,𝑐2, and 𝑛0such that:

c1.n2 <= 7n2 + 8n - 9 <= c2.n2 

for all 𝑛 ≥ 𝑛0.

Let's first find an upper bound:

7𝑛2 + 8𝑛 − 9 ≤ 7𝑛2 + 8𝑛2 + 9𝑛2 
7𝑛2 + 8𝑛 − 9 ≤ 24𝑛2


So, we can choose 
𝑐2 = 24 and 𝑛0 = 1

Now, let's find a lower bound:

7𝑛2 + 8𝑛 − 9 ≥ 7𝑛2 − 8𝑛2 −9𝑛2
 
7𝑛2 + 8𝑛 − 9 ≥ -10𝑛2 

So, we can choose 𝑐1 = 1 and 𝑛0 = 1.

Therefore, 7𝑛2+8n−9=Θ(n2).

Question - 1(B)

Sure, let's apply the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the given list of numbers: 15 8 7 11 25 13 12 4.

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the list is sorted.

Step-by-step procedure:

1. **Initial List**: 15 8 7 11 25 13 12 4
2. **Pass 1**:
   - Compare 15 and 8: Swap (15 > 8)
   - Compare 15 and 7: Swap (15 > 7)
   - Compare 15 and 11: No Swap (15 < 11)
   - Compare 15 and 25: No Swap (15 < 25)
   - Compare 25 and 13: Swap (25 > 13)
   - Compare 25 and 12: Swap (25 > 12)
   - Compare 25 and 4: Swap (25 > 4)
   **List after Pass 1**: 8 7 11 15 13 12 4 25
   Number of exchanges in Pass 1: 5
   Number of comparisons in Pass 1: 7
3. **Pass 2**:
   - Compare 8 and 7: Swap (8 > 7)

   - Compare 15 and 13: Swap (15 > 13)
   - Compare 15 and 12: Swap (15 > 12)
   - Compare 15 and 4: Swap (15 > 4)
   **List after Pass 2**: 7 8 11 13 12 4 15 25
   Number of exchanges in Pass 2: 4
   Number of comparisons in Pass 2: 6
